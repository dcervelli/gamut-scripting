# What every screenshot script in this directory does the same way: open a
# gamut window of a known size where the compositor will leave it alone, drive
# it with keys, capture exactly its rectangle, and close it again.
#
# Only Hyprland is spoken here. Its Lua API places and focuses the window,
# `wtype` types into it, and `grim` captures the region it reports. The capture
# is in device pixels, so a monitor at scale 1.6 gives a 1200x800 window as a
# 1920x1280 image, which is what the README's pictures are.
#
# A script sources this file, then:
#
#   open 1200 800 ~/git/mora     the window, focused, with its first file shown
#   keys plus plus plus Up       the keys to press, one argument each
#   settle                       wait for a pan or zoom to land
#   shoot main_screenshot.jpg    into $SCREENSHOTS
#   close
#
# or, for a recording, `record x.mp4` and `cut` around the keys, and
# `gif "$film" x.gif` afterwards. The recording is gpu-screen-recorder's,
# into $FILMS, and the GIF is ffmpeg's, into $SCREENSHOTS.
#
# Three things are the environment's to say, each with a default:
#
#   GAMUT         the binary to drive        ~/git/gamut/target/release/gamut
#   SCREENSHOTS   where the pictures go      ~/git/gamut/user-docs/screenshots
#   FILMS         where the recordings go    films/ beside this file, ignored by git
#
# The window opens on whatever workspace is active, so the script is for a
# desk someone is sitting at, not for CI. Keep your hands off the keyboard
# while it runs: the keys go to whichever window is focused.
